## Integrated development environments

Good IDE is an indispensable tool for every developer. You need to match it to your personal needs, code language and specific of work.
Below are the tools I recommend.

### SUBLIME TEXT

**[Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)** is really friendly tool for all kind of developers. It works best when is well configured.
If you want to know more see the [Tutorial](https://sublimegit.readthedocs.io/en/latest//tutorial.html#sharing-our-project-with-the-world). All important informations are there (configuration, instruction, customizations, plugins, etc.).

How to install packages ? - [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation#Simple) 

**Useful packages**: 
* [Color Picker](http://weslly.github.io/ColorPicker/)  
* [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/sindresorhus/sublime-autoprefixer)

## Useful sources
* [Markdown: Syntax by John Gruber](http://weslly.github.io/ColorPicker/) - Helpful in creation of a decent README.md
